# Pathway-GNN-Discovering-Crosstalk-Genes-with-Graph-Attention-Networks

A Graph Attention Network to discover key genes that act as *bridges* between biological pathways â€” potentially contributing to **drug resistance** by enabling pathway crosstalk.

This repo contains the full implementation of **Pathway-GNN**, including graph construction, labeling, model training, and evaluation.
